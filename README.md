# Welcome to TweenRS

This is my attempt to write a Tween animation library for Rust.

## Examples

* cargo run --bin ggtween1
* cargo run --bin ggease


## Developer Notes

* This project currently relies on a local checkout of rust-sdl2 in the same parent directory as this project.
* Install rustfmt: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt
  * Run it with `cargo fmt`
