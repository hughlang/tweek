# Tweek: A Simple Animation Kit for Rust

What's a "Tween"? I can tell you it definitely isn't (this)[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tween]. 


This is my attempt to write a Tween animation library for Rust.



## Examples

* cargo run --bin ggmix
* cargo run --bin ggsequence


## UI Components and Widgets

The ggez_support folder has a number of custom components which are mostly designed to help with the examples. However, they also show how far you can go in building custom UIs with Tweek using GGEZ.


## Developer Notes


### Known Issues

* MacOS
  * A screen scaling and offset issue exists in ggez and only 1024x768 window size works accurately.
